## My process

I keep it simple. 
- Write the HTML. 
- Then write the CSS, going from top to bottom.
- Keep tweaking till I get it right. 
- Rinse and repeat.

P.S. Yep, I'm loving this!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I keep learning the same lesson over and over:

RESILIENCE is MAJOR KEY! (in my DJ Khaled voice). As long as I keep at it, I eventually figure out whatever problems I run into with the code. I'm getting better at this.



### Continued development

In this lesson, I made use of the descendant selector. It was my first time doing this and I think, moving forward, I'm going to try to keep doing something for the first time e.g. using a different selector or html element. I bet that would keep things interesting.
